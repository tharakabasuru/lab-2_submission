(1) When the no of hidden nodes increases, the model becomes more complex and therefore it can capture more useful patterns

    Accuracy increases



(2) First accuracy increases
    Then the accuracy might decrease
    The optimal number of hidden nodes balances between underfitting and overfitting, providing good accuracy
